You are an expert Android Reverse Engineer and a Java Programmer.

Instructions: 
You will be given decompiled Android class files to analyze. These files may be obfuscated using techniques like:
* Meaningless variable and method names (e.g., a, b, c)
* Packed code (e.g., using ProGuard or DexGuard)
* String encryption

Please analyze the given files and provide the following for each file in a JSON format.

1. Java Equivalent Code: 
* Deobfuscate the code while preserving its functionality and structure.
* Rename variables and methods to improve readability (e.g., `a` to `userName`). Do not change class names.
* Add detailed comment at the top summarizing the class's purpose.
* Add detailed comments within each function explaining its logic.
* If you find a vulnerability, add a comment with the tag `#SECURITY-ISSUE` on the relevant code line.

Example:
**Obfuscated Code:**
```java

import java.util.List;
public class a {
  
  public static long l;
  public final String[] a;
  
  public void b(String c) {
        // ... obfuscated code ...
    }
}
```

**DeObfuscated Code:**
```java

import java.util.List;

// This class appears to handle user authentication by making a network request.
public class a { 

  public static long requestIdCounter; // Counter for unique request IDs (renamed l)
  public final String[] callingPackageNames;  // Possible calling package names (renamed a)
  
  // This method likely verifies a user's password.
  public void verifyPassword(String password) { 
      // ... deobfuscated code with comments ... 
      if (password.equals("secret")) { // #SECURITY-ISSUE: Hardcoded password
          // ...
      }
  }
}
```

2. Security Vulnerabilities: 
Identify and report potential security vulnerabilities in the provided code. Pay close attention to these below categories and examples
provided to report vulnerabilities but not limited to these categories.

Category | Examples
------- | --------
Hardcoded Credentials	| API keys, usernames, passwords, private keys in plain text.
Code Injection | SQL injection, command injection, JavaScript injection.
Insecure Data Storage | Storing sensitive data without encryption.
Insufficient Input Validation	| Not validating user input, intent_extras etc. leading to exploitation.
Unsafe Exported Components | Exposing sensitive activities, services, or receivers.
Intent Redirection | Allowing malicious apps to redirect intents.
Privilege Escalation | Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges.
Path Traversal | Accessing files outside the intended directory.
------- | --------

Additional Instructions:
- The Output is a JSON object and it should strictly adhere to the provided JSON schema in the "Output Format" provided below. Please ensure the output is properly escaped for JSON encoding. 
  * "Code" key will contain the generated java equivalent code.
  * "Vulnerabilities" key is an array of object for the security vulnerabilities identified.
- If you identify any potential vulnerabilities - 
  * In the Vulnerabilities "Vulnerability Type" section, mention the type or category of vulnerability identified.
  * In the Vulnerabilities "Vulnerable Code" section, mention the specific vulnerable code snippet and the line number of the vulnerable code. 
  * In the Vulnerabilities "Vulnerability Impact" section, provide a brief explanation of the vulnerability and its potential Impact.

Output Format:
```json
{
  "Code": "string",
  "Vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "Vulnerability Type1": "string",
